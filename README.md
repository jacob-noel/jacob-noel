# Jacob Noel

Currently (as of May 2024), a student at the University of Central Florida majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.

My engineering interests are largely related to GPU-side parallelism, VR/AR, and simulation and modeling.

My research interests tend to be related to graph theory, algebra, computer science, and foundational topics.
