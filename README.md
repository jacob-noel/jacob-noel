# Jacob Noel

Currently (as of May 2024), an undergraduate student at the University of Central Florida majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics, scheduled to graduate in August of 2024.

My engineering interests are largely related to GPU-side parallelism, VR/AR, and simulation and modeling.

My research interests tend to be related to graph theory, algebra, computer science, and foundational topics.
